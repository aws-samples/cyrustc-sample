# Project Structure Overview

The project is a web application with a React frontend and AWS CDK infrastructure code.

## Main Directories

- `frontend/`: React TypeScript application built with Vite
- `infrastructure/`: AWS CDK TypeScript code for deploying resources

## Core Entry Points

- Frontend: [frontend/src/main.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/main.tsx) renders [frontend/src/App.tsx](mdc:frontend/src/App.tsx)
- Infrastructure: [infrastructure/bin/infrastructure.ts](mdc:infrastructure/bin/infrastructure.ts) is the CDK entry point

## Terminology

- **Backend/Infrastructure**: The CDK stack in the infrastructure folder
- **Frontend**: The React application in the frontend folder

## General Guidelines

1. Think step by step and document your thinking process
2. Write reusable and highly readable code, prioritizing readability
3. Completely implement all requested functionality without placeholders or TODOs
4. Seek clarification when unsure rather than making assumptions
5. Review code for clarity, reusability and maintainability
