# Security Best Practices

## Infrastructure Security

### API Gateway Security
- API Key required for all endpoints
- Request validation enabled by default
- X-Ray tracing for request monitoring
- CloudWatch logging with appropriate retention

### WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks
- AWS Managed Rules enabled:
  - Common Rule Set (CRS)
    - SQL injection prevention
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
  - Known Bad Inputs protection

### Authentication with Cognito
- Secure user pool configuration
- Self-registration settings configured appropriately
- Strong password requirements
- Account recovery via secure channels
- Integration with identity providers as needed

### Environment-Specific Settings
- Production:
  - Resources have retention policies enabled
  - Deletion protection enabled
  - Enhanced security configurations
- Non-production:
  - Simplified security for development
  - Resources can be destroyed

## Data Security
- Store sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement least privilege access
- Use IAM roles for service-to-service communication
- Rotate credentials and keys regularly
