# Development Workflow

## Local Development

### Frontend Development

1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`  
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Infrastructure Development

1. Navigate to the infrastructure directory: `cd infrastructure`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile TypeScript code: `npm run build` or `npm run watch` for automatic compilation

## Deployment Process

### Building the Frontend

1. Run `npm run build` in the frontend directory
2. Output will be generated in the `dist/` directory

### Deploying to AWS

1. Navigate to the infrastructure directory: `cd infrastructure`
2. Ensure AWS credentials are configured (`aws configure`)
3. Use `npx cdk bootstrap` to prepare your AWS account (first time only)
4. Deploy with `npx cdk deploy`

### CI/CD Integration

- The infrastructure includes all the necessary components for secure deployment
- The frontend is automatically deployed to S3 and distributed via CloudFront
- Cognito callback URLs are automatically updated during deployment

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. Follow Google Markdown Style Guide for documentation
2. For Python code, follow Google Python Style Guide
3. For TypeScript code, follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide

### Best Practices

1. Fully implement all requested functionality without TODOs or placeholders
2. Write reusable and highly readable code, prioritizing readability over performance
3. Review code for clarity, reusability and maintainability
4. Write clear, easy-to-understand comments

### Testing

1. Write unit tests for each Lambda function
2. Test API endpoints according to their specifications
3. Verify authentication flows work correctly
4. Test frontend components for proper rendering and behavior
