# DeepSeek Coder Performance Test Results

## Test Configuration
- Model: TheBloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-GPTQ
- Hardware: g4dn.metal with 8 NVIDIA T4 GPUs
- Test Duration: 30 seconds per test
- Prompt: "Write a Python function to calculate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence"

## Performance Metrics

| Users | Tokens/Second (Average) |
|-------|-------------------------|
| 1     | ~55.75 tokens/sec       |
| 2     | ~52.94 tokens/sec       |
| 5     | ~41.07 tokens/sec       |
| 10    | ~19.54 tokens/sec       |

## Analysis

1. **Single User Performance**: With a single user, the model generates approximately 55.75 tokens per second, which is a good baseline performance.

2. **Scaling Behavior**: 
   - At 2 concurrent users, there's only a slight decrease in performance (~5% drop)
   - At 5 concurrent users, performance drops to about 74% of the single-user performance
   - At 10 concurrent users, performance drops significantly to about 35% of the single-user performance

3. **Response Times**:
   - 1 user: ~5.12 seconds average response time
   - 2 users: ~4.78 seconds average response time
   - 5 users: ~5.99 seconds average response time
   - 10 users: ~12.01 seconds average response time

4. **Observations**:
   - The model handles 1-2 concurrent users efficiently with minimal performance degradation
   - At 5 concurrent users, there's noticeable but manageable performance degradation
   - At 10 concurrent users, the performance drops significantly, indicating a bottleneck

## Recommendations

1. **Optimal Concurrency**: For best performance, limit concurrent requests to 2-5 users per GPU.

2. **Scaling Options**:
   - Horizontal scaling: Add more GPU nodes to handle more concurrent users
   - Vertical scaling: Consider using GPUs with more memory and compute power

3. **Load Management**:
   - Implement a queue system for handling requests during peak loads
   - Consider batch processing for non-interactive workloads

4. **Further Testing**:
   - Test with different prompt lengths to understand the impact on token generation speed
   - Evaluate performance with different model quantization options
   - Test with streaming responses to improve perceived latency

## Conclusion

The DeepSeek Coder model performs well for small numbers of concurrent users but experiences significant performance degradation at higher concurrency levels. For production deployments, implementing proper load management and scaling strategies is essential to maintain acceptable response times.
